# ðŸŽµ Spotify Data EDA â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis

Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded in April 2006. It is the world's largest music streaming service provider and has over 381 million monthly active users, which also includes 172 million paid subscribers. 

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Spotify Data, aimed at uncovering patterns, trends, and insights from music streaming data. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project provides an in-depth look at song characteristics, popularity trends, and genre distributions.

**ðŸ“Œ Objective**
The goal of this project is to analyze Spotify's dataset to:
âœ” Understand song popularity trends based on audio features.
âœ” Identify correlations between tempo, danceability, energy, and other attributes.
âœ” Explore genre-based differences in song characteristics.
âœ” Visualize key insights using interactive charts and graphs.

**ðŸš€ Tech Stack & Libraries**
âœ… Python â€“ Data manipulation & analysis
âœ… Pandas â€“ Data cleaning & preprocessing
âœ… NumPy â€“ Numerical computations
âœ… Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization
âœ… Plotly â€“ Interactive charts
âœ… Jupyter Notebook â€“ Exploratory analysis environment

**ðŸ“Š Key Analyses & Insights**
ðŸ”¹ Top Trending Songs â€“ Identifying the most popular tracks over time.
ðŸ”¹ Audio Feature Correlations â€“ Understanding relationships between tempo, loudness, and danceability.
ðŸ”¹ Genre-Based Analysis â€“ Comparing song features across different genres.
ðŸ”¹ Popularity vs. Release Year â€“ Analyzing how music trends have evolved.
ðŸ”¹ Feature Distributions â€“ Visualizing energy, valence, acousticness, and instrumentalness.


**ðŸ“¢ Conclusion & Findings**
âœ” Energy and danceability have a strong correlation with song popularity.
âœ” Acoustic tracks tend to have lower popularity in mainstream playlists.
âœ” Pop music dominates the most streamed songs list.
âœ” Music tempo trends have shifted over the years, with faster beats becoming more common.

ðŸŽ§ This project provides valuable insights into music trends, listener preferences, and song characteristics using data-driven analysis.
